I Discovered a profound love for music during my college years, where I embarked on a journey that would shape my identity as a DJ and music enthusiast. Armed with nothing more than a laptop and a free version of Virtual DJ, I delved into the art of mixing, crafting mixes that resonated with my peers. It was during this time that one of my mixes, aptly named "The Warm Up Mix," captured the hearts of many, igniting a passion within me to pursue music with unwavering dedication.

Later I transitioned to Serato DJ, mastering the decks and elevating my performances to new heights. House parties and local shows became my canvas, where friends and classmates would show up to support and inspire me, fueling my drive to push boundaries and explore new horizons in music.

Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, I delved into the realms of remixing and mashups, experimenting with diverse genres and sounds to create unique and captivating compositions. Alongside this, I began crafting original beats, pouring my soul into each melody and rhythm, striving to leave an indelible mark on the world of music.

My journey as a DJ is more than just a pursuit of passion; it's a mission to bridge cultures and connect people from all walks of life through the universal language of music. With every beat, every mix, and every performance, I aim to break barriers and foster unity, spreading joy and inspiration to all who lend me their ears.
